Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Vishrut Mishra
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
The divide-and-conquer paradigm is often used to find an optimal solution of a problem. Its basic idea is to decompose a given problem into two or more similar, 
but simpler, subproblems, to solve them in turn, and to compose their solutions to solve the given problem.
